# Subnetting-Utility

This project was created to develop a tool to allow quick subnetting of networks. A user should be able to enter an IP address with CIDR notation and get a result
of the number of hosts available as well as the number of subnets available. This tool should also be able to produce each subnets addresses. Future versions 
will allow a user to enter the amount of subnets needed, or amount of hosts needed and the program should display which CIDR is needed, as well as the Subnet addresses.
